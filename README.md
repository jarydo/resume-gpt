## Overview

One of the hardest things about applying for a job for the first time is creating the 
first draft of your resume. Overthinking, self-doubt, imposter syndrome...these are just a few
of many feelings you might face. The purpose of this tool is to help the user get over that
initial step. Utilizing the GPT-3.5 API, Resume-GPT takes in your desired job, employer,
previous work and extracurricular experience, and uses artificial intelligence to create
a downloadable cover and resume. This is not meant to be submitted as is - 
but it is a great starting point.

NOTE: A OpenAI GPT-3.5 subscription is required.

## How to Run

1. Clone repo
2. In the project directory, run `npm install`
3. Add your info to a new `.env` file (following the example.env format)
4. `npm start`

And that's it!

When inputting your experiences or education, follow the format: "degree/job at school/employer"
